# gofmtv

`gofmt` alternative which uses 2 whitespaces instead of the default tab for indentation

## Features

`gofmtv` is slightly modified based on the original [gofmt](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/b8ac61e6e64c92f23d8cf868a92a70d13e20a124/src/cmd/gofmt), retaining all its functionality except for indentation rules.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/malitsplus/gofmtv@latest
```

## How to use

See the [original gofmt document](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt).
